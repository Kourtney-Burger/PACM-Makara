SWFSC,SWFSC_PASCAL_2016,PASCAL_2016,"The Passive Acoustics Survey of Cetacean Abundance Levels (PASCAL 2016), was a large scale passive acoustic survey to obtain improved distribution and population size data for deep-diving species, namely beaked whales (Ziphiidae), sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), and dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (Kogia sp.).",,Shannon Rankin <shannon.rankin@noaa.gov>,,,
SWFSC,SWFSC_CCES_2018,CCES_2018,"The 2018 California Current Ecosystem Survey (CCES) was a multidisciplinary survey of the marine ecosystem from southern British Columbia, Canada to northern Baja California, Mexico. This survey was a collaboration between the Southwest Fisheries Science Center’s (SWFSC) Fishery Resource Division (FRD) and Marine Mammal and Turtle Division (MMTD). The survey included oceanographic measurements, use of multi-frequency echosounders, surface trawls, vertically and obliquely integrating net tows, continuous underway fish egg sampling, visual line-transect surveys for marine mammals, photographic capture-recapture studies of marine mammals, strip transect surveys for seabirds, and passive acoustic surveys of marine mammals using Drifting Acoustic Spar Buoy Recorders (DASBRs). The recordings collected in this project have been analyzed to detect echolocation signals from beaked whales, sperm whales, and dwarf and pygmy sperm whales.",,Shannon Rankin <shannon.rankin@noaa.gov>,,,
SWFSC,SWFSC_ADRIFT_2021-2023,ADRIFT_2021-2023,"ADRIFT in the California Current uses passive acoustic drifting buoys to study ocean sound in the California Current Ecosystem. The relatively low-cost buoys can be deployed and recovered from most vessels, including: research, fishing, and tourist boats. They drift autonomously and can be monitored shoreside via a satellite messenger. Data collected through the ADRIFT project will be used to assess noise levels and seasonal marine mammal acoustic presence in the California Current.",,Shannon Rankin <shannon.rankin@noaa.gov>,,,
SWFSC,SWFSC_CalCurCEAS_2024,CalCurCEAS_2024,"The California Current Cetacean and Ecosystem Assessment Survey 2024 (CalCurCEAS 2024) was a 4 month shipboard line-transect survey off the contiguous U.S. West Coast. Data collected included marine mammal visual observations, seabird sightings, cetacean biopsies, eDNA water samples, passive acoustic recordings, and uncrewed ariel systems (UAS) photogrammetry. These data will contribute to estimations of population abundance and distribution of cetaceans in the California Current.",,Shannon Rankin <shannon.rankin@noaa.gov>,,,
