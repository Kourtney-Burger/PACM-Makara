This folder contains the code to create worksheets for the Makara database. 

Follow the [Create_Makara_sheets.R script](https://github.com/Kourtney-Burger/ADRIFT-PACM/blob/main/Makara/Create_Makara_sheets.R) to create new sheets or edit the support sheets. 

**Note:** These scripts are intended to streamline the Makara data submission sheets but some fields will need to be manually entered. Refer to the Makara Data Submission Guide (in progress) for details on individual data fields. All sheets should be manually reviewed for quality assurance after using these helper scripts. 

More information on Makara can be found [here](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/PAM_National_Network/content/SI%20coord/PAM_priority_projects/PAM-Cloud-PACM.html)
